# Western Memory Game

### A Quiet Day in the Saloon
You may be new to town, but it will take more than a little confidence to take care of the issues that plague or dusty town. Many rough and wild cowboys have attempted to beat this little game, but none of survived...

Step up and test your hands at the memory game. If you take more than 10 guesses you'll lose more than the game. Behind the cards lie dangers such as a poisonous snake, a mustached villan and cursed boots.

Good luck

### Code
Built with HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS

### Future Goals
I am continuing to build out small, fun games and would like to rebrand the games into a learning site for kids to learn math. For this game I want to create custom multiplication cards that would have problems to solve. An example would be a card with "4 x 3" and a corresponding match of "6 x 2". The learner would not only be memorizing where cards were, but also matching "12" with "12".
