# Western Memory Game

### A Quiet Day in the Saloon
You may be new to town, but it will take more than a little confidence to take care of the issues that plague or dusty town. Many rough and wild cowboys have attempted to beat this little game, but none of survived...

Step up and test your hands at the memory game. If you take more than 8 guesses you'll lose more than the game. Behind the cards lie dangers such as a poisonous snake, a mustached villan and cursed boots.

Good luck
